# An Ethereum based Auction
This is a sample code showing different features and approach to creating and Auction using 
- Solidity
- Truffle
- JQuery
- Private Chain (or any other eth network, I have used private)

Using the xxxFactory you can create and auction of <Product>. 
The product instance will have specified number of tickets to be auctioned.
Some basic validations are implemented and events raised to indicate errors.
 
The code for polling for the receipt till the transaction is commited in n blocks is taken from here:
https://ethereum.stackexchange.com/questions/1187/how-can-a-dapp-detect-a-fork-or-chain-reorganization-using-web3-js-or-additional

This is a work in progress, or I may stop working on this once I feel I have got engouh info. For now and I am no UI guy so the screens will look crappy.

This will cover all the basic features that one would need while building a simple dApp using ETH
